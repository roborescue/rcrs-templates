Give an overview of the modules in your system, and the relation between them. Think of modules like: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, Autonomous Navigation, Autonomous Explortation, Victim Detection, Team Coordination, etc.
%%
\subsection{Module Descriptions}
%%
Module details. Cite the research where your approach is based on, and highlight the modifications that you have made to get it working in this context.
%%
\section{Results}
If you have done experiments to measure the performance of one or two of your modules, please present them here. When possible, use the performance of previous year algorithms as benchmark to show your progress.
%%
\section{Conclusions}
%%
Summarize the main contributions and innovations, indicate the possible impact of your improvement and provide some ideas for future research.
